    <div class="about">
        <h1>Many of the different types of stars in our solar system are made of elements.</h1>
        <p>Many of the different types of elements are Hydrogen, Helium, Oxygen, Carbon, Nitrogen, Neon, Magnesium, Silicon, Sulfur, Iron, Silver, Gold, Oxygen, and much more. These different types of elements vary on each stage of a star. But it's amazing to see the different types of elements that are formed. Over the course of this website, you'll see the different types of elements formed and what each element can be used for in Earth.</p>
        <br />
        <p>As you scroll thru the pages, you will see the different types of star formation elements that occurred and what can be made from these elements.</p>
