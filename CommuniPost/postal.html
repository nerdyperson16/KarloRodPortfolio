            <p>Here at CommuniPost, we're ensuring that you save your money and get the delivery you need without paying extra costs. This guide doesn't contain anything international (we apologize but we're working domestically within the US).</p>
            <p>This guide will be added continuously so if you don't find anything you're looking for, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@karlostevenr.page">contact@karlostevenr.page</a></p>
            <h2>Packages:</h2>
            <p><span class="postal_bold">First-Class Package Service</span>: This is the cheapest way to ship a package. This is best for use for envelopes or packets which you can purchase via stores like Dollar Tree or Walmart. Although, shipping with cardboard boxes is also best. Dimensions of the box do not count against you for shipment but lbs/ounces are counted against you when shipping. Unless the package is 5lbs or larger, this is the best way to ship a package cheaply. Remember, this service comes with USPS Tracking but does not include insurance unlike Priority Mail. Note that USPS First-Class Package Service cannot be purchased online thru USPS.com (services like PayPal Shipping, eBay, Stamps.com, etc. can be purchased online.)</p>
            <p><span class="postal_bold">Priority Mail</span>: Priority mail is one of the most common shipping methods used by the USPS. Fun fact, some USPS Priority Mail limits are 70 lbs. Something to know. So if your package is 5lbs or over and under the limit of 10lbs, I highly recommend choosing Priority Mail. This also includes if you wish for insurance up to $50.00 since it comes included with the service and USPS tracking. Not to mention that speed is a main factor when getting to its destination.</p>
            <p><span class="postal_bold">Priority Mail Express</span>: In my opinion, Priority Mail Express is not worth it. But they all have the same features as Priority Mail that I know of. Though, to take into factor of price and speed, it's not worth it. Prices can be up to $26.32 and speed is questionable. I had a friend ship a package to me via USPS Priority Mail Express and shipment took around 2-3 days instead of the 3-4 days you could of used for Priority Mail. This was all before COVID-19 and any busy holidays that we know of. Use with discretion but if you need your package there as soon as possible, Priority Mail Express maybe your best option.</p>
            <h2>Additional:</h2>
            <p><span class="postal_bold">Signature</span>: Do not get this service for residental use. We understand that you want to know that your package got to the recipient safely but you must know that there are ways "signature included" are used. The USPS ships with "signature included" when you purchase something thru USPS.com usually. Anyone can ask if your name is the recipient and they don't have to sign anything. Signing will only provide proof of delivery, not whether the person recieving it is the one. Plus, on Informed Delivery by USPS, users can opt-in to electronic signature delivery if they're not home. So an electronic signature can be used instead of an actual person. So from all of us here at CommuniPost, DO NOT GET SIGNATURE. It's not worth it.</p>
