            <p>Welcome to CommuniPost! Here at CommuniPost, we strive to educate the consumer, that's you, on learning the basics on delivering packages and mail thru the postal system. CommuniPost will educate you thru the United States Postal Service as a main service but we will bring in UPS, FedEx, and DHL into the mix in most cases. Learning the basics can save you time at the post office and you can teach yourself some things that you probably didn't even know about at your local post office.</p>
            <p>Here at CommuniPost, we will not sell you anything. If you're probably wondering where the scales for packages are, we're not that type of website. This website is simply in educating yourself on delivery and not on selling you something you probably don't need.</p>
            <p>Now that we've got the other stuff out of the way, let's learn on how CommuniPost can help you deliver today!</p>

                <h3>Do you really need to write the postal address when you have a postage?</h3>
                <p class="datecreated">7/29/2020 at 12:43 AM</p>
                <p>OK! So I went to the post office a week ago while I was sending my package and instead of myself going to the self-service machine, I went to the actual desk so I can pay cash in front. I went ahead to the desk and I had the cash already with me since I used the USPS Price Calculator service on USPS.com (Not Sponsored). So I went ahead with my phone on my hand with the address and I asked if I can purchase "First-Class Package Service" for my parcel. He looked at my packaging and asked "do you have the address?" And I said "yes." And he said, "well you don't have the address labeled on the parcel." I told him, "I usually purchase the label at the self-service machine and I don't label the parcel, I have the address though on my phone." Through a small-conversation dispute, I eventually asked him to give me back my parcel and I'll just mail it another time. I then went ahead to another post office with a self-service machine (the one I originally went to didn't contain one) and purchased the shipping label from there. The reason I couldn't just write the address on the parcel was because that there was a drawing on the parcel that I didn't want disturbed. So, here's the age-old question, can you ship packages without an address on the front but just have the address on the postage. Well... Yes. You can ship the package. Here's the thing though, it's recommended to write it in case the postage does get ruined but also unlikely as postal workers have phones that can scan the shipping label and provide them with the receipient's address. Now this question is complicated but postal workers wouldn't rely on the address written on the packaging as someone can write themselves their own address and steal the package from there. The shipping label is basically a secure way to ship your package and ensure that it gets there. We've got a ton of things to think about but to sum it up, yes you can ship a package with just the address on the postage. But if you're wondering if it'll still get there... Yes. Many of my packages that I shipped via "First-Class Package Service" was successfully shipped without any problems that I occurred.</p>
