        <h3>We're just like the ordinary...</h3>
        <p>We don't have anything new. We're just like every single photography business in the local area. But, here at Karlo's Photography, we strive to showing the plentiful places around Washington.</p>
        <h3>See which places you want to go to...</h3>
        <p>Explore the endless possibilities in Washington. Look at the shape of the trees. Or maybe look thru how the flowers bloom. Karlo's Photography's goal is to get you out of your home and into parks, recreation, and walks around. Instead of staying cooped up at home and watching TV, go out to your state park or walk around to places you've never seen before.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>My name is Karlo. Welcome!</h3>
        <p>I took one high school course to get me to show you the photos here (and 1 year of web design). As a newbie photographer, I try to take photos of the wilderness around us and see which types to go thru. I created this website only to show some web design skills and photography of where I go with my DSLR camera. I hope all of you can enjoy the different types of views there are. Something not a lot of people have ever seen before.</p>
        <h3>Checking out Washington State...</h3>
        <p>From the state parks around here or the city parks near the stores, my goal is to check out each park and trail in Washington. You can go thru the photos I take and see which park or trail is where so you can venture forward and take photos of either the same thing or take photos of other things miraculous here in the state.</p>
