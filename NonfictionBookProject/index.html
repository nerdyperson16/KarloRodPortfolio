                <h2 title="Geeks by Jon Katz - Introduction Pg. 26">"What, Exactly, is a geek?"</h2>
                <p>Geeks are essential to the everyday job that everyone is in. Even though geeks are looked below on and insulted in many ways, they still happen to be successful as everyone uses technology and needs that tech to ensure stability in the workplace.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Geeks by Jon Katz is a story about two boys, Jesse Dailey & Eric Twilegar. The two guys, just getting out of high school, were working at small jobs. Jesse, working at Emco Computers and Eric, working at OfficeMax. Both of them were unsure about their lives. Both of them trying to figure out life, they wanted something interesting. That's when they met Jon Katz. Jon met Jesse from an online messaging service. Jesse was the first member of Geek Club back when he was in high school. He communicated with Jon Katz on anything technology-related including about Geek Club and also talked about his life in the online community and about Eric Twilegar, the second member of Geek Club and roommate of Jesse. Jon Katz found himself, after exchanging phone calls and messages to Jesse, traveling to Idaho to meet Jesse himself.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Upon meeting Jesse Dailey, Jon wanted to know more about him. Jesse showed him to places in Caldwell, Idaho. He saw and explored the life of Jesse like at Emco Computers or that one Chinese Place run by white Mormons. When he got together with Eric Twilegar, he saw that both of them were equally smart in technology world. Jon Katz asked, why he didn't move. Both being suspicious of the idea, Jesse quickly started researching on his computer. He found many jobs where geeks would fit in. Eric, wondering to himself and gaining the courage says, <span title="Geeks by Jon Katz - Pg. 14">"Jeez, he told Eric. Katz is right. We can go anywhere we want. Let's get the hell out of here."</span> Even though Jon Katz didn't mean that they should leave right now, the situational irony that occurred started an adventure for Jesse and Eric.</p>
                <br />
                <p>So why is the message "Geeks are essential to the everyday job that everyone is in. Even though geeks are looked below on and insulted in many ways, they still happen to be successful as everyone uses technology and needs that tech to ensure stability in the workplace."? The tone is positive in the sentence. It's to exemplify a point where Geeks are successful in the workplace and can succeed in their future. Geeks are smart because they focus on that hobby and have more past experience with it. But the tone becomes negative where you can get insulted. Geeks are insulted and looked down on because we work behind the scenes. No one knows who we are and people can bully us since they've never seen us before. The classification of geeks are people that know their hobby. People that like something, like technology, are the people that succeed more in the future since their career is set to the hobby that is used in the workforce and this makes people knowledgeable since they have been learning this on the site with school and education.</p>

            <h2 title="Geeks by Jon Katz - Pg. 6">"Ernie looked a bit surprised to see that Jesse must have been telling the truth—some writer guy from New York had met him on the Net and had actually com all the way to Caldwell to talk to him. In fact, I anticipated that I might have to overcome some wariness from Jesse’s employer, or puzzled colleagues, or cautious family members urging him to be careful. He was only a year out of high school, after all."</h2>
            <p>It all takes one spark just to start a story? I'm sure everyone can relate.</p>
            <p>It all started from Jesse Dailey. Jesse was the one that emailed Jon Katz about Geek Club which was a club created by Jesse. Jon became interested in Jesse because of how he communicated. They talked about technology and life in general and Jon Katz found himself flying to Jesse all from simple email communication. Jon Katz written the story to bring light to geeks around the world. Here was one person that simply sat around a small town while he could be finding jobs in other big cities with his skills.</p>
            <p>Geeks was published in 2000. Technology would make efficiency higher in speed for employees. Technology started to be implemented in the workplace to make it easier for companies to gather data and organize that data instead of using self-human resource platforms.</p>
            <p>Jon Katz also had his encounter with 'new-technology' people that are trying to get to know more about how technology works. This was during the time when parents were concerned about the internet being a dangerous place for kids. When he attended an interview, he was asked a question. <span title="Geeks by Jon Katz - Introduction Pg. 20">"Just last week, a nine-year-old girl was lured into a park by some pervert online and raped," she announced in professional alarm. "Is that the kind of thing Mr. Katz wants us to ignore?"</span> Jon Katz explained his point of view and argued that the internet is not as bad as we think. He explained also that kids were already in a dangerous place in the real world instead of the web. He exemplified the fact though that the internet is not a horrible as we think. According to Jon himself, <span title=" Geeks by Jon Katz - Introduction Pg. 20">"It seems so dumb for us to be sitting here in a TV studio- with all the junk that you people put on the air all day, from soap operas to freeway shootings-and have to actually argue that the Internet isn't a dangerous place."</span> It exemplified a point though... If you think about it, TV has many action stories and shows. This is an issue since kids can easily watch this. The internet is the same thing, we will see stories or games or other information considered inappropriate. But they both are hand to hand. They both provide information which can be bad or good at the same time. So this is contradicting TV and the Internet. They both provide information but can both be biased at the same time. The analogy Jon Katz made was that from Soap Operas to freeway shootings, there is a comparison showing that the internet is alike since the internet provides information and an choosing to watch soap operas or see freeway shootings like videos or articles.</p>

            <p>I get it. You're uninterested. You don't think that this book suits you. But tell me this, are you a geek?</p>
            <p>Geeks can be defined in many ways. It's kind of hard to decipher whether or not you're a geek. But, if you feel like you're a geek, you're a geek.</p>

                <li>Do you zone out and solve fun problems and puzzles instead of work?</li>
                <li>When you're working, have you ever thought about what it would be like being the CEO of the company?</li>

            <p class="qa">If you answered yes, then according to Jon Katz, you're a geek!</p>
            <p class="qa">If you answered no, then I don't believe you. Everyone is technically a geek.</p>

And if you are saying you aren't a geek because of its name, geeks are needed in this world. They succeed. They become leaders. Even though geeks are introverted, we're still smart and intellectual. Even if you deny it, we all know you're a geek and everyone else is. Just think about it.</div>

                <p>Everyone can relate to this sentence. Everyone faced criticism, whether it was a grade or a critic. The excerpt showed also the tone. The attitude that he makes was positive in the end but negative in the beginning. The "I don't care if you think I'm a two-headed freak..." explains that he doesn't care at all but still provides a negative output because of the "two-headed freak". The positive though was "I think I'm better than you and smarter than you..." meaning that he believes in himself and doesn't care what others say that tries to put him down.</p>

            <h2 title="Geeks by Jon Katz - Pg. 14">"Geeks can get jobs almost anyplace. People everywhere need people who can maintain, repair, and understand computer systems. it's a universal need, don't you think?"</h2>
            <p>These are for the people that categorized themselves as ‘other’. Being introverted either raising tropical fishes, composing a poem, writing code, meeting friends online, or playing by yourself.</p>
            <p>Do you think you fit this category? Because, I think everyone does if they like a certain hobby.</p>
            <p>The book consists of narration of Jon Katz experience with Jesse Dailey and Eric Twilegar. You will see his experience as he talks to Jesse and his experience from high school and living with Eric in an apartment. Then, they will travel away from Idaho to search for new jobs that will help them get further in their technological experience. This can be seen as the exigence where the spark of how the book was started was from Jesse Dailey when he communicated with Jon Katz for the first time.</p>
