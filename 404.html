    <h1>There seems to be an issue - Error 404 : No Directory</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Hmmm. That's weird! I wonder why there's no website directory for this site. I was probably at IKEA getting some Swedish Meatballs when I must've stumbled and added some code that directs you to nowhere</p>
    <p>I still wonder why this directory doesn't exist. Something I have to look over. No matter, just click the back button on your browser and head back to my website. I'll figure it out as soon as possible if I can figure it out.</p>
    <p>While you're here though, think about what made you stumble here... Was it because you were trying to find some secrets on this site or there was litteraly no link.</p>
    <p>If you don't mind, email me at contact@karlostevenr.page and tell me what happened. It could help me a lot!</p>
    <p>Well don't want to leave you hanging... Here's a picture of my favorite drink. I'll let you reverse image it yourself.</p>
