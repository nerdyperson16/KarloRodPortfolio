  <h1>Error 404</h1>

  <p>Huh... This website page doesn't exist. I wonder why I created this site if this section doesn't exist. I must've been going to IKEA and getting some Swedish Meatballs.</p>
  <p>If you want to get back on the original site, click the back button on the website so you can go back on my website.</p>
  <h2>I need to figure out what went wrong so I'll have to check it out later.</h2>
