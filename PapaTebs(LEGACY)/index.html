            <p>It all started when Papa needed a mask. Ever since Papa goes to work, we see hundreds of disposable masks go to waste and to landfill. COVID-19 has started an epidemic that caused masks to be thrown in landfills and garbage cans and seeing hundreds of these masks go to waste will simply cause another issue at hand.</p>
            <p>That's why we're making masks! Ever since we released our reusable prototype, we've been making masks like crazy! We've created over 50 masks every week and what's better is that it's reusable! Simply put it in the washer after use and instead of throwing it away... Put it in your bag for another use for another day.</p>
            <p>There's so many designs to choose from and we can't wait to make you your very own mask. From our variety of options that have been custom handcrafted, PapaTebs is here for you to create your very own mask.</p>
