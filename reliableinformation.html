            <h2>Learning about Reliable Information</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 15px">By: Karlo Rodriguez (Student at the University of Washington Bothell) and Richard Hendricks (Software Developer & Designer at Pied Piper)</p>
        </section>
        <section class="articleNotes">
            <h2>Reliable Information in a nutshell</h2>
            <p>Finding reliable information can be difficult when it comes to research. As James Patrick Sullivan has said, "...reliable information can be a difficult scenario to find. You would have to look at the author, date of publication, who is publishing it, and much more..." (Sullivan, 25). But the fact of the matter is that information for research topics and development is difficult.</p>
            <br />
            <p>To search for information that is accurate and correct, you need to look at who is publishing your article. What is the publisher trying to show? Is the person publishing the article a real person? Or are they someone who is biased against a group or for a group. A nice way to search for reliable information is by doing a quick Google search. Check what the author has written. And don't believe everything you see when you first read a paper by that author. Like Jon Arbuckle, a professor at the University of California Davis Division of Information Studies, says: "Your information is an important study that you must look closely at. An author may be trying to pursuade you that puppies are bad. But maybe that author is saying that because they work for an organization that believes puppies should not exist. Maybe that author isn't the right person to look at" (Arbuckle).</p>

        <section class="articleNotes" style="text-align: center">
            <h2>How do you look for reliable information</h2>
            <p>Whenever you write an article, it is your job to write accurate and correct information. You should not have to lie or fake your story entirely. If you faked your information, you would be encouraging disinformation intentionally and spreading incorrect information.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Some ways to look at when searching for information is:</p>
            <ol style="text-align: left">
                <li>Check the author. Don't assume they're a credible source. Look them up on the internet.</li>
                <li>Check who is publishing the article. Are they biased against a certain topic, or are they unbiased and looking at all sides?</li>
                <li>What's the author's purpose of writing the article?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Only these are some ways to search for reliable information. But it's not all. It's encouraged that each and every one of you search the author's credibility on information and the publisher's purpose of writing the article. You can try it right now by searching the authors that were used on this article.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Here's a video also that explains more about searching for reliable information and more depth on our reasoning for this article.</p>
