            <h1>What I have learned from B WRIT 132 & B WRIT 133</h1>
            <h4>By Karlo Rodriguez | Student Spy from the University of Washington Bothell</h4>
            <p style="color:red">Author's Note: I have infiltrated the University of Washington Bothell to gain insight in the different educational paths that other schools were doing. Even though Squidward Community College has millions of degree pathways and classes available on the main campus, I was interested in trying to <s>steal</s> borrow information that writing classes are doing at UWB.</p>
            <p>
            One of the most effective uses of my time in B WRIT 132 was the Strategic Summary portion from Sequence 2. As a class, we used the text Handicapped by History: The Process of Hero-Making as an example for the assignment. From that, we were tasked to summarize the text while gaining enough context, key ideas/claims, and providing examples. I believe this was an important assignment mainly because of the use of summarizing something to someone. In many cases, I would try to summarize a movie or an article. But I find myself adding additional information from that source that is unnecessary and useless for the reader. Sometimes, I would summarize something without even saying the title or who the author is. As an example, I am currently reading a book called The Movement: How I Got This Body By Never Going To The Gym In My Life. I would explain the story to some people about how someone named Jack Garbarino was trying to become fit through a fitness workout of carrying boxes. However, I would need to add additional context to the story, such as trying to explain that Jack Garbarino was never real, and the book was a fictional story made up for a comedy TV show called Nathan For You. Trying to fit in all the information would be critical to summarizing the book as people would need to know who made the book and explain the key ideas inside the book that the author was trying to write. This is so the person trying to understand the story also knows the key ideas while understanding the author’s intention in writing the book.
            </p>
            <p>
            On B WRIT 133, I found that several writings (like Our Sea of Islands or My Identity, My Allegiances) were helpful in gaining the purpose of the writing. The purpose is an important point in finding why the writer is writing the text in the first place. Sometimes, it’s harder to find the purpose of the writing in the conclusion or introduction. But I do know that trying to find the purpose of the writing did help to make some sense of what the text is trying to say and the stakes behind what the author is trying to explain, so the reader gets something out of it. Typically, I would write something on my paper but never explicitly explain more about the purpose behind why I am writing something in the first place. Even if I don’t mention it in the introduction or conclusion, I would want to try to get the reader to understand or learn something from my paper. However, I still find that making sure to write the purpose of the text is difficult as sometimes I would just write down what I have in my head and forget what I am trying to focus on. But that’s something I will still need to improve on. The writings from B WRIT 133 did help solidify that knowledge on trying to write a purpose and staying focused on that in my text.

            Thank you, Professor Liz, for allowing me to be in your class and encouraging us to continue this writing path. You have made my first-year college experience exciting, and I can’t thank you enough. I should also add that during one of the assignments of overanalyzing text (I think it was from B WRIT 132), I wrote an Op-Ed piece for the UWB Husky Herald Student Newspaper. I can definitely say that many of the experiences I learned from B WRIT came from that. So, thank you for everything.
